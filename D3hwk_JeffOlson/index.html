          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Lack of healthcare increases with increased poverty rates.  This is supported by state to state
		  data shown above.  Click on the poverty axis title and you will see that data.</p>

          <p>Lack of healthcare is a function of age as well (select the "Age (median)" title on the x asxis).
		  This is completely understandable since younger individuals have been traditionally covered by their
		  parents healthcare. As they grow older and gain experience in the workplace they are able to acquire 
		  healthcare.</p>

          <p>The data also shows that with increases in median household income lack of insurance is reduced.</p>

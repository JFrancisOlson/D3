This is my homework for the D3 homework.  a very challenging assignment.

Download this folder, open git bash and drive to the D3hwk_JeffOlson, then use " python -m http.server " to render the index file. 

 - notes:
  1 - I couldnt get the states abbreiations to map to the circles.  I came closebut for some reason they are mappin to the svg origin. 
  2 - but I did get the multiple axis and hover effects for x axis on the js/app.3.js
  3 - I also began working on the js/app.4.js javascript to be able to render multiple axis on the y axis and select as you do on the x axis.   thats interesting but its not complete.  I have learned alot from this assignment. 
  
  Thanks, 
  
  Jeff
